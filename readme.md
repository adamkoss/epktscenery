# EPKT Scenery
> Katowice-Pyrzowice Airport Scenery for X-Plane 10
## Instalation 
If you have installed additional scenery, instalation will be easy for you.
If it is your first time, follow step by step:
### First etap
- extract all folders (EPKTscenery, Custom Data) from downloaded archiwum 
### Second etap - adding scenery files:
- EPKTscenery folder put in to "Custom Scenery" folder (located in main X-Plane folder)
### Third etap - adding navigation files:
- Open downloaded "Custom Data" folder (contains earth_nav.dat, earth_fix.dat, EPKT.txt)
- Open default "Custom Data" folder (located in main X-Plane folder)
- now, you have two solutions:
    - if you don't have files in default "Custom Data" folder yet - you should earth_nav.dat and earth_fix.dat put in to this folder. 
    - if you have already earth_nav.dat and earth_fix.dat files - open EPKT.txt file, copy first part (with "FIX" heading) and paste to earth_fix.dat, copy second part (with "NAV" heading) and paste to earth_nav.dat.
## It's all! Have a nice flight!
